You're worthless and you'll never amount to anything.
I can't believe how stupid you are sometimes.
Why can't you be more like your brother?
Why can't you be more like your sister?
You're grounded for a week for saying that word!
I don't care if your friends say it, you're not allowed to use that word.
You're lucky I don't hit you for saying that word!
You're not leaving this house until you apologize for using that word!
