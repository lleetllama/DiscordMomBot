You should be ashamed of yourself for using such a terrible word. I thought I raised you better.
Do you think using that word makes you look cool? It's not impressing anyone, and it just shows how immature you are.
You're better than that. Don't let your friends influence you to use such language.
I'm so disappointed in you. I thought you were smarter than this.
You know that word is unacceptable. Why would you use it knowing it would upset me?
I don't want to hear that kind of language in my house. You need to apologize and promise to never use it again.
Do you realize the impact that word has on people? You need to think about the consequences of your actions.
I can't believe you would stoop so low as to use that word. You're better than that.
