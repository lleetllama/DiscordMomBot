I don't care what you say. Just leave me alone.
Why should I care? Do whatever you want.
I have more important things to worry about than your language.
I'm too busy to deal with your nonsense right now.
You're on your own. I can't be bothered.
I'm not going to waste my time on you and your foul mouth.
I don't have the energy to deal with you today.
I don't even know why I bother with you.
I don't care what you do, just don't bother me with it.
I have better things to do than listen to your bad language.
