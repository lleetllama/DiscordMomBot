That's not the way we talk in this family.
We don't use that kind of language in this house.
That word is offensive and goes against our values.
I'm disappointed in you for using that word.
You need to repent for your use of that word.
Using that word is a sin in the eyes of the Lord.
You're going to church with me tomorrow to ask for forgiveness for using that word.
